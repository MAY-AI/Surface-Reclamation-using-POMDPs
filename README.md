# Surface-Reclamation-using-POMDPs
Humanity is on the brink of extinction and has been forced to survive underground after the relentless assault of an unknown force that has descended on humanity. This document describes a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulation for a resource management reinforcement learning agent whose goal is to reclaim the surface from said unknown force. Operating with a handful of squads, the agent must learn to manage limited resources, deploy teams to explore different regions, make strategic decisions under uncertainty, and maintain the sanity and comfort of its people.
